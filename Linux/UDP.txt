UDP: User Datagram protocol
Transfer protocol of IP provides fast, connectionless and lightweight communcation between processes.
No guarantee of delivery, or error checking making it suitable for real time and time sensitive application such as video streaming, DNS, VoIP.
Header has 8 bytes long followed by data payload
has source port , destination port and length , checksum [all 16 bits][optional in UDP]

Advantages:
1. DNS uses UDP for fast query/response lookups.
2. DHCP uses UDP to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices where small msg is exchanged.
3. VoIp uses UDP for real time voice communication. No delays, tolerates some packet loss.
4. RIP uses UDP for send periodic routing updates between routers.
5. NTP uses UDP to synchronize system clocks across networks with minimal overhead.

UDP used in DDOS attack[distributed denial of service]: attackers sends large no of UDP packets to target port exploiting UDP's connectionless nature.

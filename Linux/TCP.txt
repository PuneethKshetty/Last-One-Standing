TCP:
1. connection oriented protocol that helps in exchange of messages between different devices over a network.
2. Operators on Transport layer. between application and network layer in OSI
3. IP works with TCP to send data packets between computers.
4. Reliable connection between sender and receiver using Three way handshake[SYN,SYN-ACK,ACK] and uses 4 way handshake[FIN,ACK,FIN,ACK] to close connections properly.
5. Features: Segments numbering, connection-oriented, full duplex, flow control, error control, congestion control.

Working of TCP:
1. Data segmentation: application data divided into small segments for efficent transmission insteading of sending all at once.
2. Routing. Each segment can take different route through network, depending on traffic or congestion ,reach same destination.
3. Reassembly: At receiver's end, TCP resassembles these segments into original message using sequence numbers.
4. Acknowledgment: Receievr send ACK messages back to confirm successful receipt of each segment.
if ack not received, TCP retransmits missing segment.
5. Error and Flow control: TCP uses checksums to detect errors and sliding window mechanims to control flow of data.

Advantage:
1. Reliable
2. make sure data reach proper destination in exact order sent.
3. Well documented and widely implemented
4. Works in conjunction with IP

Disadvantage:
1. TCP runs several layers so slow down speed
2. TCP made for wide area networks so size can become issue for small network with less resource.
3. Cannot work with BLE connection.

Sliding window protocol: allow multiple packets before receiving Acknowledgment and uses window for managing packet flow improves network efficency.
over long distance or high latency networks.
Sliding window protocols are used where reliable and ordered delivery of packets is needed, such as in the Data Link Layer and the Transmission Control Protocol in Transport Layer.
